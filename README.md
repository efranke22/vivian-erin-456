This repository was created by Vivian Powell and Erin Franke to study water contamination in the Twin Cities, specifically with a focus on superfund sites and PFAS in the Twin Cities. Superfund sites contain hazardous material including PFAS, which can have harmful affects on the health of the environment, humans, and other organisms. We created a Shiny app to identify where these superfund sites are located and how they have progressed in their cleanup of harmful chemicals overtime.
