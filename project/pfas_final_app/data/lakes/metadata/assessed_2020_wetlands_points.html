						Title: 
					</span><span>Assessed Wetlands Points, Minnesota, 2020</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Abstract: 
					</span><span>This is a set of the centroids of the wetlands assessed by MPCA's surface water quality assessment process for the 2020 303(d)/305(b) integrated report to EPA. 
<br>
<br>These wetlands are a subset and enhancement of the 1:24,000 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD). In cases where the NHD does not include wetlands that MPCA has assessed, additional wetlands from the MN Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Division of Waters lakes database are added. Since the assessed wetlands are a small subset of the NHD and DNR lakes, only that subset is included in the dataset. This dataset includes impaired wetlands which have not yet had a TMDL plan approved by the US EPA as well as wetlands that support aquatic recreation and those that had insufficient information to render a support judgment.<br></span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>

					</span><span>These data are intended to be used for planning, informational, and cartographic purposes related to surface water quality in Minnesota.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>

				</h2><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Attribute Accuracy: 
					</span><span></span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Logical Consistency:
					</span><span>These data have been audited to ensure every wetland included in the 305(b) submission to EPA has a corresponding feature in this dataset, and that the use judgments are consistent between this spatial dataset and the assessment database as of the publication date. Date of test: 4/9/2019</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Completeness:
					</span><span>	These data contain a feature for every beach in the 305(b) inventory of assessed waters. High-resolution NHD is the primary dataset from which these features are drawn. If no feature exists in the NHD, MPCA staff will digitize a feature.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
						Horizontal Positional Accuracy:
					</span><span>	Statements of horizontal positional accuracy are based on accuracy statements made for U.S. Geological Survey topographic quadrangle maps. These maps were compiled to meet National Map Accuracy Standards. For horizontal accuracy, this standard is met if at least 90 percent of points tested are within 0.02 inch (at map scale) of the true position. Additional offsets to positions may have been introduced where feature density is high to improve the legibility of map symbols. In addition, the digitizing of maps is estimated to contain a horizontal positional error of less than or equal to 0.003 inch standard error (at map scale) in the two component directions relative to the source maps. Visual comparison between the map graphic (including digital scans of the graphic) and plots or digital displays of points, lines, and areas, is used as control to assess the positional accuracy of digital data. Digital map elements along the adjoining edges of data sets are aligned if they are within a 0.02 inch tolerance (at map scale). Features with like dimensionality (for example, features that all are delineated with lines), with or without like characteristics, that are within the tolerance are aligned by moving the features equally to a common point. Features outside the tolerance are not moved; instead, a feature of type connector is added to join the features.
<br>This statement is generally true for the most common sources of NHD data. Other sources and methods may have been used to create or update NHD data. In some cases, additional information may be available from the data provider upon request.</span></div><br><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>

<br>AQR: Aquatic Recreation Assessment
<br>FS: Fully Supporting aquatic recreation use
<br>IF: Insufficient Information for an assessment
<br>NA: Not Assessed
<br>NS: Not Supporting aquatic recreation use
<br>

<br>
<br>AQL: Aquatic Life Assessment
<br>FS: Fully Supporting aquatic life use

<br>
<br>Minnesota's adaptation of the EPA's Consolidation Assessment and Listing Methodology (CALM) categories and subcategories:
<br>
<br>1: All designated uses are met and no use threatened.
<br>2: Some uses are met; none are threatened and insufficient data to assess other uses.
<br>3A: No data or information to determine if any designated use is attained.
<br>3B: Data are available for a review and generally indicate non-support, but insufficient data and
<br>information to determine TMDL impairment. (Example: single lake data point showing non-support)
<br>3C: Data available that currently has no assessment tools to allow its use in assessing.
<br>(Example: data with only eco-region expectation standards)
<br>3D: Data are available for a review and generally indicate full support, but insufficient data and
<br>information to assess for category 1 or 2.
<br>3E: Data are available for a review, but insufficient data and information to determine full support or
<br>TMDL impairment. (Example: lake data just below the threshold showing non-support)
<br>4A: Impaired or threatened but all needed TMDLs have been completed*
<br>4B: Impaired or threatened but does not require a TMDL because it is expected to attain standards in
<br>the near future*
<br>4C: Impaired or threatened but does not require a TMDL because impairment not caused by a pollutant*
<br>4D: Impaired or threatened but does not require a TMDL because impairment is solely a result of natural
<br>sources*
<br>5A: Impaired or threatened by multiple pollutants and no TMDL plans approved.
<br>5B: Impaired or threatened by multiple pollutants and either some TMDL plans approved but not all or at
<br>least one impairment is the result of natural conditions.
<br>5C: Impaired or threatened by one pollutant.
<br>* Assessment units falling into category 4 are impaired waters, but are not part of the 303(d) list because of the
<br>reasons given above in the category descriptions. EPA has identified subcategories 4A, 4B, and 4C for classifying a segment, where available data and/or information indicate that at least one designated use is not being supported or is threatened, but a TMDL is not needed. Minnesota has chosen to further subdivide Category 4C into subcategories 4C and 4D to differentiate between cases of impairment due to non-pollutants (4C) and natural background (4D). All category 4 waters appear with the category 5 waters on an impaired waters inventory, which is a comprehensive list of all the current impaired assessment unit/pollutant combinations.</span></div><br><div class="mgmgel"><span>
